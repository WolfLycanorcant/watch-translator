# Quick APK Build Guide

## Option 1: Fix Expo Login & Build (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create/Reset Expo Account
1. Go to https://expo.dev
2. Either create a new account or reset your password
3. Use a simple password you'll remember

### Step 2: Login and Build
```bash
# Login with your credentials
eas login

# Build the APK
eas build --platform android --profile watch-debug
```

### Step 3: Download APK
- Check your email for build completion notification
- Or visit https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-username]/projects/watch-translator/builds
- Download the APK file

## Option 2: Use Expo Go (Quick Test)

### Step 1: Install Expo Go on your watch
- Download "Expo Go" from Google Play Store on your watch

### Step 2: Start development server
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Scan QR code
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
- Your app will load directly without building APK

## Option 3: Alternative Build Service

If Expo login continues to fail, you can:

1. **Use GitHub Actions** (I can set this up)
2. **Use Appetize.io** for web-based testing
3. **Use React Native CLI** for local build (requires Android Studio)
